//Requirements
//1. When the user guesses a letter, add that letter to the App component's guessedLetters state.
//2. Each guess can only consist of 1 letter at a time.
//3. Consider using the spread operator when adding the new letter to trigger React to re-render.
//4. The existing starter code logic will read guessedLetters and render correctly-guessed letters in the Word Display section and render all guessed letters in the Guessed Letters section.
//5. Add logic and state to track whether the user has guessed all letters of the word and how many guesses the user has left (can start with 10).
//6. If the user guesses all letters correctly, tell them they have won. If the user runs out of guesses, reveal the word and tell them they have lost.
//7. When the round ends, give the user an option to play again.
